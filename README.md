Summary
---------
This S3 browser displays the list of files and virtual folders in your S3 bucket.

This code is based on the original implementation by Nolan Lawson (https://github.com/nolanlawson/pretty-s3-index-html) with my own multiple fixes and enhancements. Also I completely redesigned the implementation of virtual folders.

Usage
-------
Just place the index.html file in the root of your bucket and give it all the necessary permissions.
