Summary
---------
A Bootstrap-y, pretty index.html designed to be placed at the root of a public Amazon S3 bucket, which
you just want to use for displaying a list of files.

This code is based on the original implementation by Nolan Lawson (https://github.com/nolanlawson/pretty-s3-index-html) with my own fixes and enhancements.

Usage
-------
Just place the index.html file in the root of your bucket.
